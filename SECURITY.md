# Security Notice

## What?

This is the security notice for all Homes England repositories. The notice explains how vulnerabilities should be reported to Homes England.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Homes England is an advocate of responsible vulnerability disclosure. If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, we would like to know so we can fix it. This notice provides details for how you can let us know about vulnerabilities.

You can report a vulnerability to Homes England by email to [disclosure@homesengland.gov.uk].

When reporting a vulnerability to us, please include:

- the website, page or repository where the vulnerability can be observed
- a brief description of the vulnerability 
- details of the steps we need to take to reproduce the vulnerability
- non-destructive exploitation details

If you are able to, please also include:

- the type of vulnerability, for example, the [OWASP category](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/)
- screenshots or logs showing the exploitation of the vulnerability

If you are not sure if the vulnerability is genuine and exploitable, or you have found:

- a non-exploitable vulnerability
- something you think could be improved - for example, missing security headers
- TLS configuration weaknesses - for example weak cipher suite support or the presence of TLS1.0 support

Then you can still [reach out via email](disclosure@homesengland.gov.uk).

## Guidelines for reporting a vulnerability

When you are investigating and reporting the vulnerability on a GDS domain or subdomain, you must not:

- break the law
- access unnecessary or excessive amounts of data
- modify data
- use high-intensity invasive or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities
- try a denial of service - for example overwhelming a Homes England service with a high volume of requests
- disrupt Homes England services or systems
- tell other people about the vulnerability you have found until we have disclosed it
- social engineer, phish or physically attack our staff or infrastructure
- demand money to disclose a vulnerability
